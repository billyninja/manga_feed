===MangaFeed

Quite a generic project name. Initially a toy project for practicing while I'm reading Mastering Object-Oriented Python from PacktPub.

The goal here is to download Scanlated Manga from a given source (e.g: mangareader.net) convert it to a more practical format for e-readers, like mobi and e-pub.
